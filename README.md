# Umovies - A movie Web Application

Umovies is a demonstration of a movie website built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
and [The Movie Databse (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/).


## Why?

I love to develop Web Application and I want to learn more about SvelteKit. In some way, I wanted to test my skills in SvelteKit.
*All in all, Just for the fun of it*
